                Phong shading is our reflection model used to calculate the colours of our objects. Phong shading is an evolution of Gourad shading which interpolates
                the normals of each vertex instead of interpolating the colours.

                Flat shading is the simplest model, we have a single normal for each polygon and the shading is constant on all the surface. 
                In Gourad shading we have a normal per vertex, we compute the colour for each vertex and then interpolate it between all of the vertexes of the polygon.
                Phong shading is the most complex model between the tree. Instead of interpolating the colour between vertexes we interpolate the normals and then calculate the colour for each fragment.

                A directional light illuminates the objects only from one direction, a point light illuminates the objects from all directions from a given point.
            </li>

                To compute the lighting for glossy objects we need the direction towards the observer. The easiest way to compute is by using the eye position. 
                So we can say that the eye position influences the shading of an object

                The highlight disappears
            </li>

            <li>
                as the shiningness increases the highlight get's smaller and viceversa
            </li>

            <li>
                The lighting was computed in world space coordinates
            </li>
